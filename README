# Description of this mini-project

Type "make all" and run the resulting executable to see the program
sort a randomly generated list of numbers using selection sort

This is a demonstration using the well-know selection sort of how I
like to use descriptive variables to clarify how a programmed procedure works.

# TODO

- Reimplement the random array generator using macros for consistency across all code,
    especially as it is confusing to have a "DATA_TYPE_MACRO" and a "DATA_TYPE_ENUM"
    at the same time.
- Explain in my own words using comments how the algorithm works (maybe)
